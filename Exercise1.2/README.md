## Data Structure
### Exercise Aim
Create a structure that contains a set of attributes related to a specific recipe, and several of these “recipe structures” need to be stored sequentially in another outer structure.

### Data Structure Choice
For this type of data I will choose 'dictionary' to store the recipe information because the attributes for a particular recipe are defined by name (labeled) thus I should/could pull or upddate a needed data using its key value or using the 'get()' function rather than using index on lists and tuples. Furthermore, there are plenty of operations I can perform on this data structure that enables me to create and manipulate the details easily.
